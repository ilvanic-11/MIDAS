# MIDAS
Midi-Intermediary Digital Art Suite

A gui\toolkit for data analysis, algorithmic generation, and manipulation of visual music.

Out of Box Usage:
Navigate to the 'dist' folder and run the green-icon executable you will find there. 

What is Midas?
MIDAS was developed to solve the problem "How do I do Visual Music?" 
It was designed to be a composing\drawing\sculpting tool; a cross between a tool like Microsoft Paint combined with the musicology availed with music21. 

What is Visual Music
What started off as a fun project to encode information (e.g. Morse Code, Braille, etc.) as music expanded into visualizing and transforming imagery into musical compositions with Python displayed using a PianoRoll. 

Digital Audio Workstations and PianoRolls.
DAWs have PianoRolls for visualizing compositions and playback. Music is displayed with 2 axes where the y axis is pitch and x axis is time. Using wxpython as the GUI framework, MIDAS features a simple PianoRoll for drawing/composing/generating music.

Eventually visualizations took a step further with a Mayavi 3-dimensional interactive display. With numpy as a unifying data type, velocity and tracks can be used for visualizing the 3rd axis as z.
