--IP--Commit, THANKSGIVING, November 26th, 2020
In Musicode
--> In the make_musicode() function, tweaked the directory writing.
--> In the make_musicode() function, added functionality to export ENTIRE musicode as ONE midifile, ON TOP OF the other method of individual midi files.
In Mayavi3DView
--> Fixed the 'triangle' glitch for the red reticle; makes it so it doesn't go outta whack when one scrolls outside the grid's range.
--> Add attribute 'self.number_of_noncolorscall_actors. Updates +=1 upon calling new_actor(). (Used to *differentiate between actors that are explicitly part of a colors-png import and not.)
In PianoRoll
--> In function OnMouseWheel(),(ZoomHorizontal and ZoomVertical related.) added extra 'not' conditions to prevent conflict with other functions that use Shift and Control.
In PianoRollPanel
--> Eliminate obsolete buttons. Added "Brush" button (no functionality yet)
--> Added Z Scrolling functions: --> (Selection_Send(), ArrayFromSelection(), Scroll_ZPlanesVelocities())
--> Added "import numpy_indexed as npi" to the module's imports.
In Midas_wx
--> Added GrabnSend() function. Works in conjunction with Scroll_to_Z.
--> GrabNSend has three sends: ---> (While holding down middle clickShift, Shift sends to scrolled_actor, Alt sends to scrolled_zplane, and Ctrl sends to the pyshell as a numpy array and a music21.stream.Stream())
--> Added function ShowCurrents(). (useful for debugging. Shows select_notes, CurrentActor().cur_z, mayavi_view.cur_z, mayavi_view.cur_ActorIndex, Midas.actor_scrolled, Midas.zplane_scrolled, pianoroll.last_push, pianoroll.last_actor)
In ZPlanesListBox
--> Added Activate_Zplane() function, derived from self.OnListItemActivated.
In actorListBox
--> Added feature: new_actor()s are now color-coded on creation, with exceptions made for colored image imports(they have they're own sorted colors, obviously). The colors are drawn from the current color palette selection based on self.current_pallete_name. 
--> Added Activate_Actor() function, derived from self.OnListItemActivated.
In midiart3D
--> Fixed an import bug (--> ...from vtk.util.numpy_support import *blah ---to---> ....from vtkmodules.util.numpy_support.....]))  (probably vtk update related)
In music21funcs
--> Cleaned up some docstrings that may have been confusing upon a novice first glance. (separate_notes_to_parts_by_velocity())
In Midas_Startup_Configs
--> Added "import numpy_indexed as npi" to Midas's startup configurations.
In Midas-Mayavi_Pip_Batch_Install.bat
--> Updated with numpy_indexed
In Mayavi3idiArtAnimation(old module, not our Mayavi3DView), MIDAS_UnitTests.py, MIDAS_wx, PianoRoll, PianoRollPanel, Preferences, MainButtons
--> Hashed out imports not used. 
In MainButtons
--> Added a line of '-=' code to the colors import function to prevent color imports from updating 'self.number_of_noncolorscall_actors.' (*see above differentiation.)


--IP--Commit, December 12, 2020
In MidasCommitLog
--> At the bottom of the log, there is a ##Git adds. It is a copyable line of code that can be thrown in to git with ctrl v to git add a lot of changes quickly. Subject to change, and updates. (Things commonly committed will be added to this line of code.)
In MenuButtons
--> Assigned "Ctrl+Alt+I" to toggle the "Intermediary_Path" folder.
In MainButtons
--> Revamped and Changed the UpdatePreview() dialog function so that, when a selection (colors, edges, monochrome) is True, the actual transformation from (set_to_nn_colors, canny,  will appear as the preview. (MAJOR time saver.)
--> Created the functions self.OnCheckBoxSelection() and self.OnChangeColor(). They are used to trigger self.UpdatePreview() based on color selection and the above checkboxes.
--> Implemented use of wx.ListCtrl for the selection of the current_pallete_name within the MidiartDialog.
--> Ensured consistency of "views" across the board for the colors process flow. (preview, mayavi_view, FL Studio midi export view.) #TODO Fix core tuple inversion problem.
In midiart
--> Updated (for all current midiart functions) the table of contents. All are now listed.
--> Created function def cv2_reconversion() so that I could display the edge detection in the MidiartDialog preview.
In Midas_wx
--> Fixed startup bug where titles in the mayavi_view weren't working.
In Mayavi3DWindow
--> Refactored function select_moved_actor(), more readable. (a traits function) Made a small tweak where Focus() happens as well as select. (Difficult to see blue 'selection' against black in alb)
In PianoRoll
--> Wrote function self.ZoomToHere(state=None) (which is invoked inside of the right-click menu function OnPopup_ScrollHere())  Note: SetScrollRate(1,1) for this function to work.
--> Wrote function self.ScrollHome() (invoked inside OnPopup_ScrollHome)
--> Renamed irrelevant menu button functions inside OnCellRightClick() (which summons the menu bar)
--> #TODO Midas.SendToHere()
--> Wrote variable functions self.SetScrollRate()----> Sets to (1,1) for precision scrolling or to default (160, 120) == (Two Octaves, One Measure)
In MIDAS_UnitTests.py 
--> Eliminated redundant imports at the top.


--IP--Commit, December 24th, 2020
In PianoRollPanel
--> Renamed(refactored) function self.clear_out() to self.clear_out_highlight
--> Completed self.Selection_Send() function working within the same zplane. This transform_xy method is the equivalent of a dragndrop on the same grid.
--> Battled events, fixed some flag bugs.



***All branches up to this point have been to Isaac's Mayavi Branch



--IP --Commmit, December 30th, 2020
In GitHub
--> Did two test commits and created a new git branch entiteld "Adding Span and Velocity". This branch is intended to explore optimization. The mayavi branch is still for the tracks of thought on which I was already and am still working.



--IP--Commit, January 1rst, 2021--> Branch = Isaac's Mayavi Branch
In midiart3D
--> Bug Fix0: changed open3d.read_point_cloud to open3d.io.read_point_cloud.
--> Fixed an indent causing unnecessary loop calls in function get_planes_on_axis()



--IP--Commit February 15th, 2021-- (Dual Commit, to be merged.)
Branch: --> Isaacs_Mayavi_Branch
In PianoRollPanel
--> Fixed bug for zplane pushing (changed mistake self.last_push to self.zplane_scrolled on line 415)
--> In addition, completely changed zplane pushing, accounting for all 'send 'to-and-from'' conditions. Works within the "CurrentActor()," not working yet when sending between actors.
In midiart
--> Inverted the "FLStudioColors" and "FLStudioMayaviColors" dicts. Since a lot of functions call for the (1-16) keys, most things don't break from this change. Fixed a new_actor() colors bug. (still having problems with inverted colors, eventually will all need overhaul)
--> Tweaked the kwargs in the function midiart.convert_dict_colors(), fixed a small problem with startup.
In midiart3D
--> Tweaked function midiart3D.delete_select_points(). Changed a for loop to a list comprehension. Modified an inside function's kwarg. (ln 351 in midiart3D: from tupl=False --to--> tupl=tupl)
----->Main fix
In pianoroll, pianorollpanel, zplanesctrlpanel, Mayavi3DWindow(mainly pianoroll)
--> In pianoroll, used code within ChangeCellsPerQrtrNote() to create another function called AdjustCellsBasedOnCPQN(). Called at the beginning of zplaneslistbox.Activate_Zplane(), a major cpqn problem\bug has been solved with a workaround. (The zplane\cpqn bug.)
---------------
In Mayavi3DWindow
--> Added traits attribute self.previous_ActorIndex, a sister attribute to cur_ActorIndex index, but referring to the last\'previous' actor activated. 
In Actor class
--> Added traits attribute self.previous_z, a sister attribute to cur_z, but referring to the last\'previous' zplane activated. 
In ZPlanesControlPanel.zplaneslistbox
--> Modified the Activate_Zplane()\OnZplanesListItemActivated() function to update the self.mayavi_view.CurrentActor().previous_z attribute upon changing\'activating' a new zplane.
--> Added an if\else check in the Activate_Zplane() function for the scenario of switching back and forth between the same zplanes.
In ActorsControlPanel.actorListBox
--> Modified the Activate_Actor()\OnListItemActivated() functions to update the self.mayavi_view.previous_ActorIndex attribute upon changing\'activating' a new actor. (These allow for new event dynamics.)

--> Created new module Playback.py and new class Playback(). 
--> Added pyo to the Midas-Mayavi_Pip_Batch_Install.bat file.
--> Added pyinstaller to the Midas-Mayavi_Pip_Batch_Install.bat file.
In music21funcs
--> Cleaned up hash in function separate_notes_to_parts_by_velocity()
--> New function: merge_notes_to_one_part() 
In midiart
--> Caught Bug: fixed missing parentheses in .reshape method used inside funtion midiart.lists_of_to_array()
--> Added import mido to list of imports within module
--> New function: create_midi_header()
In music21funcs
--> New function: add__timesig_and_metronome()
In Gdrive

In color_palettes
--> Added 60 NEW color palettes from Lospec.com
In Mayavi3DView

--> Implemented method to have OPTION to user either mlab.volume_slice() or mlab.mesh() versions of the plane scroller.
--> Changed class variable self.volume_slice to self.slice and self.slice edges. Self.volume_slice is now a Boolean determing which OPTION to use. (True will be Volume Slice, False will be Surface\Mesh)
In Actor
--> Implemented actor_points_changed() fix for new Core Data Update(see Trello card.) (array4d and points data additions)
--> part of CORE DATA UPDATE --> Changed self._array3D to self._array4D. Changed the 'shape' of self.array4D from (5000, 128, 128) TO (5000, 128, 128, 5). This allows for (On\off, Velocity, Duration, Span, SAN)
In MenuButtons

--> Got rid of the neon green background color of the mainbuttons 'panel.'
--> Hard coded the size=(75, 36) attribute of the self.btn__Music21_Converter_Parse wx.Button. Makes the contained text more readable.
--> In function _append_musicode_tools(), added variable list "cancel_strings" to eliminate unwanted menu buttons adds in our dynamic tools menu for 'musicode'.
--> In function MusicodeDialogue(), fixed a bug where the Main Button "Musicode" was failing to continue to highlight upon mouse hover after being activated once. 
In mainbuttonspanel.3idiArtDialogue()

--> Used multiprocessing to allow the program to load WHILE the Musical_Matrix_Rain.py is running.
In Musical_Matrix_Rain
--> Changed delay value at end from 5000 to 19500 (miliseconds)
--> Reinstantiated in MIDAS_wx.py. (Turn off for testing.)

--> Added "Yellow" to the possible colors of the rain.
In Preferences
--> Cleaned up imports at top of module.
--> Added a now multiprocessing based _Timer() class for use in the InfiniteTimer() class. Didn't work as expected.


--IP--Commit  January 2, 2022--
--IP--VACATION AND NEW YEAR COMMIT
In General, overall
--> Incorporated Core Data Update focus on durations, our _array4D and _points found in our Actor() class.
--> Fixed alb and zlb listbox scroll bugs.
--> Fixed miscellaneous bugs as per development; testing ongoing.
--> Cleaned up some docstrings, wrote some new functions
In Mayavi3DView, Mayavi3DWindow
--> In generate_plane_scroll() function, changed .position = i to .trait_set(position = i)
--> Renamed mlab_calls list to "sources". Deleted mlab_calls as "mlab_calls" and "sources" were identical lists. Came from scenario of two programmers doing the same work and arriving at the same conclusion for list usage, naming them differently.
--> Immediately reversed this, restoring mlab_calls as a list.
--> HUGE: Shortenend the length of the self.grid_cells_length from 2500 to 256. Makes colors imports super speedy fast.
--> In establish_highlighterplane(), fixed the red_reticle box to load position correctly on startup when there are no actors loaded.
--> Fixed startup configurations where The Midas Display is as accurate without as with an actor loaded.
--> Moved class functions zoom_to_coordinates(), redraw_mayaviview(), and clear_all_and_redraw()to MIDAS_wx MainWindow() class functions.
--> In traits function reset_index_attributes(), fixed a variable name bug preventing the 2nd half of the function from running (self.filter changed to alb.filter). Also added prints to the function to for testing. Currently, all delete actor functions are working. 
--> In Actor() class, and project throughout, changed all instances of old array3D to array4D as well as in hash and array3Dchangedflag to array4Dchangedflag
--> In Actor() class, wrote in some comments about color changing.
--> In Actor() class, wrote function get_points_with_all_data(z=None, _array4D=None). np.argwhere does not get our new duration data, so this function was created to replace and add to our use of np.argwhere.
In midiart
--> In function array_to_lists_of(), added an assert statement at the top to assert for type numpy.ndarray
In midiart3D
--> Eliminated the round() calls from the rotate_point_about_axis() function.
--> Edited the docstring of extract_xyz_coordinates_to_stream()
--> New function: get_point_indices() making use of imported module numpy_indexed as npi. Installed options for on_points from np.argwhere and current_zplane_only. Tested. Works. Pycrust examples included in the docstring. The type checking was probably why I failed before.
--> In function 
In PianoRoll
--> Changed  ...array4D[:, :, self.m_v.cur_z][0]  TO-->  ..array4D[:, :, self.m_v.cur_z, 0] in function GridToStream(). This fixed a bug with the Main Button, "Update Stream."
--> In self.PCR, in Draw() function, synced wx.grid Draw() color with the mayavi_view.CurrentActor() color.
--> Created function AdjustGridLengthBasedOnCPQN(self, newcpqn, oldcpqn, oldNumCols). This function was required to make self.grid_cells_length = 256 work properly and efficiently.
--> In _table, modified DeleteCols() and AppendCols() appropriately for new grid adjustment functionality.
--> Added new class variables self.draw_velocity AND self.draw_duration.  These work together with our Core Data Update, self.draw_cell_size, and self._cells_per_qrtrnote to effectively implement the drawing of durations in our _array4D, _points, and _stream actor attributes.
--> Added function SetDrawingDurationValue()
--> Added function SetDrawCellSizeValue()
--> Added function GetMusic21DurationRatio()
--> Changed drop down button "Cell Draw Size" to "Drawing Duration"
--> In ._table (our PianoRollDataTable(), adjusted function SetValue() accordingly for our new data setting (ON, VElOCITY, DUR1, DUR2).
In actorsListBox
--> Added ClearZPlane() to alb.DeleteCurrentActor()
--> Updated alb.filter logic in UpdateFilter() function.
In ZplanesListBox
--> Updated alb.filter logic.
--> ADDED UpdateFilter() function and applied same logic for zlb.filter.
In mainbuttons
--> Adjusted layout of MIDIartdialog() by adding AddSpacer() to the layout calls of one of the box sizers.
In Midas_wx
--> In function ShowCurrents(), added self.m_v.current_pallete_name, self.m_v.default_color_palette, and self.m_v.default_mayavi_palette to list of "currents" shown with this function.
--> Moved mayavi_view functions zoom_to_coordinates(), redraw_mayaviview(), and clear_all_and_redraw() here to MIDAS_wx MainWindow() class functions.
--> Updated function ShowCurrents() per work on colors stuff.
--> In function OnScrollActors_Zplanes(), fixed scroll bug using alb.filter and zlb.filter methodology.
In musicode.py
-->In musicode class, fixed bugs from zplov commit. rdbtnMusicodeChoice list wasn't being updated when a user created a musicode, as a line was deleted. 
-->In _translate_musicode_letter() made fix with line --> element_wrapper = [i for i in measure.getElementsByClass(["ElementWrapper"])][0] instead of what was a bunch if-elif in a block.
In MenuButtons.py
--> In function OnIntermediaryPath(), moved dropdown menulist string "Midi files (*.mid)|*.mid|" to the top. Changed order to .mid, .txt, .png, .jpg, .ply, allfiles.
In Project
--> Eliminated 'f*ck' prints vulgarities from everwhere.
--> Changed ALL non-MIDAS_wx "self.mayavi_view" instances\variables to "self.m_v". DID NOT do a refactor, I found\replaced them manually using Ctrl+Shift+F within pycharm.
	--(cont.) --> Now, when I search for "mayavi_view" with ctrl F, it finds all the primary instantiations in each class in the form of self.m_v = self.GetTopLevelParent().mayavi_view.
	
	
--IP--Commit  February 14, 2022--
In Project
-->-->Made passes and adjustments for extract_xyz_coords_to_array()stream() in all places adding "durations=True" as necessary

In pianoroll
--> Fixed bug in ChangeCellsPerQrtrNote() fuction where self.SetCellDrawingSizeValue() was being called before the 'write' instance of self._cells_per_qrtrnote
In MainButtons
--> In function OnLoadImage(), fixed a bug in the "wildcard" argument of wx.FileDialog that was preventing jpgs from being usable.
In ActorsControlPanel
--> In function OnBtnDelActor(), fixed a bug where function ClearZplane(z) was calling for the variable "current" which was referring to an actor index; a small mistake.
--> New function --> OnGoToFirstEmptyActor()
--> New function --> OnGoToNearestEmptyActor()

In ZPlanesControlPanel
--> New function --> OnGoToFirstEmptyZplane()
--> New function --> OnGoToNearestEmptyZplane()

In PianoRoll
--> In class our _table PianoRollDataTable, rewrote _table.SetValue() and GetValue() functions to appropriately allow for the getting and setting of duration data and other data.
--> Refactored variables in appropriate functions to accomodate this CORE DATA UPDATE. Testing in progress...
--> Fixed a bug in function AdjustCellsBasedOnCPQN() that prevented execution when the zplane to which user was switching was activated.
In PianoRollPanel
--> In function OnMouseLeftUp(), added self.pianoroll.ForceRefresh() to force the durations to update 'appearance-wise' in the grid upon drawing a note and then deleting it at note-onset(not the tail of the note) right away.
In MainWindow
--> Wrote protected function _delete_mayavi_views(), which deletes all instantiations of self.m_v pointers\variables to self.mayavi_view throughout Midas. The only pointer that this function doesn't delete is the main one: "self.mayavi_view".
In midiart3D
--> Fixed a bug in get_planes_on_axis() function that prevented the "ordered" kwarg functionality from doing what it was supposed to do; the odict actually wasn't ordered when set to True-- FIXED!
In Mayavi3DView
--> Fixed a calculation bug in generate_plane_scroll() (for the final time....) where frames_per_beat was being factored in twice. 
--> 

In midas_scripts/musicode
--> In make_musicode(), fixed a bug in the file path where the files weren't getting written to the correct directory.
--> In make_musicode function, moved the "Assert for measures" code block up so that it gets called at the appropriate time, order-wise. The measures check is now working as such.
In midas_scripts/midiart
--> Fixed documentation of make_midi_from_colored_pixels() function. Changed "list" to "dict" in parameter docstring.
--> In function make_pixels_from_midi(), changed np.zeros method to np.full, giving the user option to select pixel\note color AND background color.
In Midas-Mayavi_Pip_Batch_Install
--> Added LICENSE mark to all packages. 

In Kivy
--> REVIVED KIVY
--> Got working instances of translation functions complete
--> Got working instances of midiart functions complete
--> GUI layout DONE.
--> Named Kivy version MIDAS_Mobile
--> Got MIDAS_Mobile complete!!!!!!!!  The only thing that would add to it is the funciton --> filter_pixels_by_key()
