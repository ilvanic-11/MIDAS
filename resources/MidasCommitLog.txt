--IP--Commit, October 6th, 2020--
In MenuButtons
--> In OnExport_Colors --> Changed  methdo ".Name" to ".GetItemLabel" text (line 290 as of this commit) as necessary for wx(4.1.0)
--> Fix: The parent inheritance *(window layout direction) for the "ToolsDialog" as well, now. Adjusted errors accordingly for wx.4.1.0 update. (horizontal alignment flags, some wx.Menu methods were renamed: i.e. 'GetName()' was changed to 'GetItemLabelText()')

--> SetFocus() sets the focus on the mainbuttonspanel on startup now.


--IP--Commit, November 3rd, 2020--
In Mayavi3idiView
--> Add "Actor_Label" to the highlighter plane. Reads text as the GetItemText() title of the current actor in the actorListBox.
--> Add mainbuttonspanel.SetFocus() to the function redraw_mayaviview()

--> Improve on "Grid Highlighting" feature so the "unselected" cells are actually removed from "self.selected_cells"
In PianoRoll
--> Change the ZoomInHorizontal() scroll binding form "Ctrl" to "Alt." ("Ctrl conflicts with the 'OnScroll_ActorsandZplanes' feature.")
In MenuBar
--> Add mainbuttonspanel.SetFocus() to OnPreferencesDialogClosed().
In ZplanesListBox
--> Disable SINGLE_SEL: allows selecting of multiple list items(this will be useful for functions acting on selections of multiple zplanes in the zplane list box. Adjusted actors\zplane list box scroll hotkey function accordingly.

--IP--Commit, November 10th, 2020--
In Mayavi3idiView
--> Redrawing mayavi view "Actor_Label" color default has been reset.
--> In function redraw_mayaviview(), fixed parent inheritance bug. 
--> Fixed miscellaneous small bugs, code wording.
In MainButtonsPanel, PianoRoll(the grid class), pyshellpanel(mycrust class), mayavi_view(control panel), ZPlanesListBox, AND actorListBox
-->Added 5 new "F" hotkeys that set the focus to the various panels of Midas from ANY of the other main panels in the application (from basically everywhere, one is able to setfocus via hotkey to somewhere else.) 
--> Hotkey list ----> (F5 -> pianorollpanel, F6-> pyshellpanel, F7->mayavi_view_control_panel, F8->actorListBox, F9->, ZplanesListBox)
In PianoRollPanel
--> Changed and improved on "Grid Highlighting Feature". Now allows for "clearing out" on 'new highlight' instances. Data is still correctly acquired in the form of self.select_notes.
In MainButtons Panel
--> Addressed syntax of OnMusicodeDialog (wx.4.1.0 update), which fixed some small musicodedialog layout problems.
In Musicode
--> Revamped the whole module. Kept old method of establishing our musicode dicts. ALSO, created a new one.
--> Cleaned up hash\garbage.
--> Fixed many bugs within mc.make_musicode function.
In Entire Project
--> Cleaned up some redundant imports at the tops of each module. (mostly musicode related for now.)
In PianoRoll, ActorsControlPanel, ZPlanesControlPanel
--> Implented right click popup menus for each panel for quick functions(later.)


--IP--Commit, THANKSGIVING, November 26th, 2020
In Musicode
--> In the make_musicode() function, tweaked the directory writing.
--> In the make_musicode() function, added functionality to export ENTIRE musicode as ONE midifile, ON TOP OF the other method of individual midi files.
In Mayavi3DView
--> Fixed the 'triangle' glitch for the red reticle; makes it so it doesn't go outta whack when one scrolls outside the grid's range.
--> Add attribute 'self.number_of_noncolorscall_actors. Updates +=1 upon calling new_actor(). (Used to *differentiate between actors that are explicitly part of a colors-png import and not.)
In PianoRoll
--> In function OnMouseWheel(),(ZoomHorizontal and ZoomVertical related.) added extra 'not' conditions to prevent conflict with other functions that use Shift and Control.
In PianoRollPanel
--> Eliminate obsolete buttons. Added "Brush" button (no functionality yet)
--> Added Z Scrolling functions: --> (Selection_Send(), ArrayFromSelection(), Scroll_ZPlanesVelocities())
--> Added "import numpy_indexed as npi" to the module's imports.
In Midas_wx
--> Added GrabnSend() function. Works in conjunction with Scroll_to_Z.
--> GrabNSend has three sends: ---> (While holding down middle clickShift, Shift sends to scrolled_actor, Alt sends to scrolled_zplane, and Ctrl sends to the pyshell as a numpy array and a music21.stream.Stream())
--> Added function ShowCurrents(). (useful for debugging. Shows select_notes, CurrentActor().cur_z, mayavi_view.cur_z, mayavi_view.cur_ActorIndex, Midas.actor_scrolled, Midas.zplane_scrolled, pianoroll.last_push, pianoroll.last_actor)
In ZPlanesListBox
--> Added Activate_Zplane() function, derived from self.OnListItemActivated.
In actorListBox
--> Added feature: new_actor()s are now color-coded on creation, with exceptions made for colored image imports(they have they're own sorted colors, obviously). The colors are drawn from the current color palette selection based on self.current_pallete_name. 
--> Added Activate_Actor() function, derived from self.OnListItemActivated.
In midiart3D
--> Fixed an import bug (--> ...from vtk.util.numpy_support import *blah ---to---> ....from vtkmodules.util.numpy_support.....]))  (probably vtk update related)
In music21funcs
--> Cleaned up some docstrings that may have been confusing upon a novice first glance. (separate_notes_to_parts_by_velocity())
In Midas_Startup_Configs
--> Added "import numpy_indexed as npi" to Midas's startup configurations.
In Midas-Mayavi_Pip_Batch_Install.bat
--> Updated with numpy_indexed
In Mayavi3idiArtAnimation(old module, not our Mayavi3DView), MIDAS_UnitTests.py, MIDAS_wx, PianoRoll, PianoRollPanel, Preferences, MainButtons
--> Hashed out imports not used. 
In MainButtons
--> Added a line of '-=' code to the colors import function to prevent color imports from updating 'self.number_of_noncolorscall_actors.' (*see above differentiation.)


--IP--Commit, December 12, 2020
In MidasCommitLog
--> At the bottom of the log, there is a ##Git adds. It is a copyable line of code that can be thrown in to git with ctrl v to git add a lot of changes quickly. Subject to change, and updates. (Things commonly committed will be added to this line of code.)
In MenuButtons
--> Assigned "Ctrl+Alt+I" to toggle the "Intermediary_Path" folder.
In MainButtons
--> Revamped and Changed the UpdatePreview() dialog function so that, when a selection (colors, edges, monochrome) is True, the actual transformation from (set_to_nn_colors, canny,  will appear as the preview. (MAJOR time saver.)
--> Created the functions self.OnCheckBoxSelection() and self.OnChangeColor(). They are used to trigger self.UpdatePreview() based on color selection and the above checkboxes.
--> Implemented use of wx.ListCtrl for the selection of the current_pallete_name within the MidiartDialog.
--> Ensured consistency of "views" across the board for the colors process flow. (preview, mayavi_view, FL Studio midi export view.) #TODO Fix core tuple inversion problem.
In midiart
--> Updated (for all current midiart functions) the table of contents. All are now listed.
--> Created function def cv2_reconversion() so that I could display the edge detection in the MidiartDialog preview.
In Midas_wx
--> Fixed startup bug where titles in the mayavi_view weren't working.
In Mayavi3DWindow
--> Refactored function select_moved_actor(), more readable. (a traits function) Made a small tweak where Focus() happens as well as select. (Difficult to see blue 'selection' against black in alb)
In PianoRoll
--> Wrote function self.ZoomToHere(state=None) (which is invoked inside of the right-click menu function OnPopup_ScrollHere())  Note: SetScrollRate(1,1) for this function to work.
--> Wrote function self.ScrollHome() (invoked inside OnPopup_ScrollHome)
--> Renamed irrelevant menu button functions inside OnCellRightClick() (which summons the menu bar)
--> #TODO Midas.SendToHere()
--> Wrote variable functions self.SetScrollRate()----> Sets to (1,1) for precision scrolling or to default (160, 120) == (Two Octaves, One Measure)
In MIDAS_UnitTests.py 
--> Eliminated redundant imports at the top.


--IP--Commit, December 24th, 2020
In PianoRollPanel
--> Renamed(refactored) function self.clear_out() to self.clear_out_highlight
--> Completed self.Selection_Send() function working within the same zplane. This transform_xy method is the equivalent of a dragndrop on the same grid.
--> Battled events, fixed some flag bugs.

***All branches up to this point have been to Isaac's Mayavi Branch

--IP --Commmit, December 30th, 2020
In GitHub
--> Did two test commits and created a new git branch entiteld "Adding Span and Velocity". This branch is intended to explore optimization. The mayavi branch is still for the tracks of thought on which I was already and am still working.

--IP--Commit, January 1rst, 2021--> Branch = Isaac's Mayavi Branch
In midiart3D
--> Bug Fix0: changed open3d.read_point_cloud to open3d.io.read_point_cloud.
--> Fixed an indent causing unnecessary loop calls in function get_planes_on_axis()
