#############################################
*Actor and Zplane list box scrolling:
		While holding down Ctrl, also hold down either shift or alt and then scroll the mouse wheel to scroll through the actorsListBox and ZPlanesListBox, respectively.

*Actor or Zplane Activation
		Once scrolled to desired list box item, release shift and alt. While still holding CTRL, scroll up to activate selected actor or scroll down to activate selected Zplane.

*Highlighter Feature(As currently constructed.)
		Select the highlight mode near the top left of the pianorollpanel. In highlighter mode, you cannot draw. Select and drag over a block of cells to highlight them. They will turn a pale blue-green.
		OR select a 'top-left' cell and then SHIFT-select a bottom right, and it will automatically highlight that entire block. Also, shift-highlighting adds to the current selection.
		Double clicking on a cell outside your selection will deselect your selection. Single click dragging will also deselect, as well as start a new selection.
		Acquiring a selection creates\overwrites existing "self.selected_cells and self.selected_notes" within the pianorollpanel class.

#GrabNSend()
		Once a selection has been acquired, (and self.selected_notes exists) we can move them around between Actors, Zplanes, and even send the data to the pycrust using the scrolling of the listboxes mentioned above.
		Hold down Middle click and press either Shift, Alt, or Ctrl. 
		MiddleDown() + Shift sends the current selection to the currently scrolled (Midas.actor_scrolled) of the actors list box, and ACTIVATES that actor as well.
		MiddleDown() + Alt sends the current selection to the currently scrolled (Midas.zplane_scrolled) of the zplanes list box, and DOES NOT activate that zplane. 
		MiddleDown() + Ctrl sends the selection to the pycrust as data in the from of a numpy np.array coords_array of points and as a music21.stream.Stream()
		MiddleDown() + 'F' send the selection to the mouse's current position in the grid.
		
#Zplane Scrolling
		After a selection has been made, we can push and pull it by small increments(to be added to preferences.) Press "F7" to set focus on the pianorollpanel.
		Then, hold down CTRL+SHIFT+ALT and Scroll up to push the selection into the background (effectively making it quieter in terms of velocity) or Scroll down to pull it closer and louder.
