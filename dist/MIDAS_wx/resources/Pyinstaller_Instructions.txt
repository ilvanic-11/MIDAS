Double click --> file://C:\Users\Isaac's\Midas\resources\pyinstaller_bug.png

If you get this bug, pyinstaller did not install MIDAS_wx properly.
When I was tinkering, although I do not understand why, I managed to fix this by deleting both the dist and build folders 
and running in CMD --> pyinstaller MIDAS_wx.py again, instead of rebuilding from MIDAS_wx.spec. 

This photo contains the verification that you have the correct path.

Second NOTE: These will only show BEFORE Step 3, before you have copied the non-pyinstallable packages into you Midas\dist\MIDAS_wx folder. It's a good way to test to save some time.
